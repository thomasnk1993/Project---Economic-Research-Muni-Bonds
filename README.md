Municipal bonds have been found to have higher than usual returns in January when compared to other months in the year. However, some research has found this effect to have declined over the past few decades. Hence, this paper attempts to assess as to whether this effect declined for both investment and non-investment grade municipal bonds over the past few decades. In addition, high yield bonds have been found to have a stronger January effect than investment grade bonds, especially within the corporate universe. Thus, this paper also researches as to whether this phenomenon occurs within the municipal bond universe. To study these questions, regression with ARIMA error specifications are utilized (transfer function models) on index data from Bloomberg Barclays Indices, which provides data up to 2017. The results indicate that the January effect has declined for investment grade municipal bonds, but has increased for non-investment grade municipal bonds. In addition, the January effect is found to increase in magnitude as the credit quality of municipal bonds decline.
